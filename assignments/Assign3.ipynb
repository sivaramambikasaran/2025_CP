    "1. Recall the coffee-cooling problem discussed in class. In this assignment, let's assume that the cooling rate $r$ is not a constant but decays with time as $r(t) = \\exp(-\\alpha t^2)$. Take the initial temperature of the coffee-cup to be $85^{\\circ}$C and the surrounding temperature to be $25^{\\circ}$C. Explore the solution for values $\\alpha \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$ per sq. minute. Note that $\\alpha = 0$ should give us the solution for constant decay rate."

    "4. In numerical solution of boundary value problems in differential equations, we can sometimes use the physics of the problem not only to enforce the boundary conditions but also to maintain high-order accuracy near the boundary. Suppose we want to numerically solve the following boundary value problem $\\displaystyle\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+y = x^3$ where $0\\leq x \\leq 1$ with Neumann boundary conditions $y'(0) = y'(1) = 0$.\n",
